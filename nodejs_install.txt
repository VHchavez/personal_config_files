Install nvm, node.js, and npm


It is always recommended to remove any existing installations of Node.js or npm from your operating system before installing a version manager as the different types of installation can lead to strange and confusing conflicts. For example, the version of Node that can be installed with Ubuntu's apt-get command is currently outdated. For help with removing previous installations, see How to remove nodejs from ubuntu.)

Open your Ubuntu 18.04 command line.
sudo apt-get install curl
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.35.3/install.sh | bash

Note
At the time of publication, NVM v0.35.3 was the most recent version available. You can check the GitHub project page for the latest release of NVM, and adjust the above command to include the newest version. Installing the newer version of NVM using cURL will replace the older one, leaving the version of Node you've used NVM to install intact. For example: curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.36.0/install.sh | bash

To verify installation, enter: command -v nvm ...this should return 'nvm', if you receive 'command not found' or no response at all, close your current terminal, reopen it, and try again. Learn more in the nvm github repo.

List which versions of Node are currently installed (should be none at this point): nvm ls

Install the current release of Node.js (for testing the newest feature improvements, but more likely to have issues): nvm install node

Install the latest stable LTS release of Node.js (recommended): nvm install --lts

List what versions of Node are installed: nvm ls ...now you should see the two versions that you just installed listed.
